 * 
 * Purpose: This class defines a Circle that inherits from TwoDimensionalShape. This class has one field that is a 
 * measure of the radius of the Circle. This field is used to calculate the area of the Circle.
 * It has a constructor to initialize the radius field and calls the constructor of TwoDimensionalShape to initialize
 * the area field of the common parent class. There is constructor chaining as when the TwoDimensionalShape constructor
 * is called, it calls the constructor of the Shape class to initialize the numberOfDimensions to 2.
 * It has a get/set method for the radius field as well as a displayArea method to print the resulting area to the user.
 * 
 * This class is a child class of TwoDimensionalShape and therefore a grandchild class of Shape. This class has no children.
 * 
 * Checking for non-negative field(s) does NOT occur in this class. That validation must occur prior to the instantiation
 * of an object of this class!
 * 
 * TYPE: REGULAR CIRCLE
