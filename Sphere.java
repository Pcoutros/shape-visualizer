 * 
 * Purpose: This class defines a Sphere that inherits from ThreeDimensionalShape. This class has one field that is a 
 * measure of the radius of the Sphere. These field is used to calculate the volume of the Sphere.
 * It has a constructor to initialize the radius field and calls the constructor of ThreeDimensionalShape to 
 * initialize the volume field of the common parent class. There is constructor chaining as when the ThreeDimensionalShape
 * constructor is called, it calls the constructor of the Shape class to initialize the numberOfDimensions to 3.
 * It has a get/set method for the side field as well as a displayVolume method to print the resulting volume 
 * to the user.
 * 
 * This class is a child class of ThreeDimensionalShape and therefore a grandchild class of Shape. This class has no children.
 * 
 * Checking for non-negative field(s) does NOT occur in this class. That validation must occur prior to the instantiation
 * of an object of this class!
 * 
 * TYPE: REGULAR SPHERE
