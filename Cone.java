 * File Name: Cone.java
 * Course: CMSC335 7381
 * Date: 10/26/2023

 * Author: Pete Coutros
 * 
 * Purpose: This class defines a Cone that inherits from ThreeDimensionalShape. This class has two fields that are a 
 * measure of the radius and height of the Cone. These fields are used to calculate the volume of the Cone.
 * It has a constructor to initialize the radius and height fields and calls the constructor of ThreeDimensionalShape to 
 * initialize the volume field of the common parent class. There is constructor chaining as when the ThreeDimensionalShape
 * constructor is called, it calls the constructor of the Shape class to initialize the numberOfDimensions to 3.
 * It has a get/set method for the radius and height fields as well as a displayVolume method to print the resulting volume
 * to the user.
 * 
 * This class is a child class of ThreeDimensionalShape and therefore a grandchild class of Shape. This class has no children.
 * 
 * Checking for non-negative field(s) does NOT occur in this class. That validation must occur prior to the instantiation
 * of an object of this class!
 * 
 * TYPE: RIGHT CIRCULAR CONE
